<h2><strong>1. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)&nbsp; </strong></h2>
<p>These <a href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-faq">FAQs</a> provide a handy entry point to our longer and more comprehensive Privacy Policy (below). They enhance rather than replace the important notices in this Privacy Policy, which governs our collection, use, storage, and sharing of the information that we collect or receive from you.</p>
<h3><strong>What’s new as of April 3, 2023?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>On April 3, 2023 we updated our Privacy Policy to reflect data practices for SafeVoice. We also made some formatting changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The difference between an edit/review and an update is that "updates" involve material changes to our Policy whereas edits are not material or simply indicate a review has occurred.&nbsp; For example, we may make clarifying edits by giving additional examples.&nbsp; When we provide an update, you will receive a notice to accept and read the changes, which are summarized here. </p>
<h2><strong>2. Privacy Policy Overview</strong></h2>
<p>Unity Technologies and its subsidiaries and <a href="https://unity.com/addresses">affiliates </a>(collectively “<strong>Unity</strong>”) offer a variety of products, Services, and websites for Developers and App Users that will be referred to in this Policy as the “<strong>Service</strong>” or “<strong>Services</strong>.” The Policy refers to Unity as “<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>” and to game players / App Users as “<strong>you</strong>.” When we say “<strong>device</strong>,” we mean any device, including desktop, laptop, PC or Mac computers, smartphones, tablets, or any other device that is used to access or interact with the Service. When we say “<strong>Developer</strong>,” or “<strong>Publisher” </strong>we mean a third party that develops and/or distributes a game or other app made with and/or using Unity Services.

<p>Developers using Unity’s Ads Service may offer any of the following three categories of applications: 1) child-directed (Users are likely children), 2) mixed audience (Users are both children and non-children), 3) non-child directed (Users are unlikely to be children). If the application is mixed audience, the Developer should implement an age-gate where required by law, and send a signal to Unity which indicates that we need to limit data collection and serve non-personalized ads. The Developer similarly categorizes applications which are specifically child-directed. A child is considered to be any User under the age of consent in their applicable jurisdiction. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event we receive a signal from a Developer, we reduce our data collection for our Ads Service. In such instances, we will only collect Personal Information listed below. We collect this Personal Information for internal operations and our legitimate interests in providing the Service.</p>
<ul><li>IP address is used to provide a compliant experience suitable for the User’s region.</li>
<li>Unique Installation-specific ID is used for operational purposes related to the serving of contextual advertisements.</li>
<li>User ID is used in connection with providing rewards in exchange for watching an ad. Unity uses a developer-set identification (User ID) to let the Developer know when a User with the User ID has completed the watched the ad and is therefore entitled to receive the in-game reward (coin, gems, etc.). &nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>Our Services are otherwise not intended for children. If you are aware that our Services are otherwise collecting Personal Information about children, please contact us at <a href="mailto:DPO@unity3d.com">DPO@unity3d.com</a></p>

<h2><strong>9. Transfers out of Country of Collection </strong></h2>
<p>Unity has implemented and maintains a framework consistent with applicable law for transfers of Personal Information outside of the country of collection, including for transfers out of the UK and/or EEA.</p>
<p>Unity has implemented and maintains a framework consistent with applicable law for transfers of Personal Information outside of the country of collection, including for transfers out of the UK and/or EEA.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have <a href="https://unity.com/addresses">facilities</a>, including <a href="https://www.is.com/">ironSource</a> which is headquartered in Israel, or in which we engage service providers, such as Google Cloud Platform and Looker, and by using the Services you understand that your Personal Information will be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.&nbsp; In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.</p>
<p>Where this will involve transferring your Personal Information outside the UK and/or EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<p><strong>Adequacy Decisions:</strong> Some non-EEA countries are recognized under the UK GDPR and by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en">here</a>). For example, we may transfer to our affiliates who are located around the world, including Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Contractual Clauses: </strong>For transfers of Personal Information from the UK and/or EEA to third countries, which are not considered adequate under the UK GDPR and/or by the European Commission, we have put in place standard contractual clauses adopted under the UK GDPR and/or by the European Commission to protect your Personal Information. For example, we use Google Cloud Platform’s infrastructure and data centers which are located around the world, including the United States. We rely on both controller-controller and controller-processor Standard Contractual Clauses. &nbsp;You may obtain a copy of these measures by contacting us in accordance with the “<strong><em>Contacting Us</em></strong>” section below. “<strong>UK GDPR</strong>” has the meaning given to it in section 3(10) (as supplemented by section 205(4)) of the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Japan </strong></p>
<p>For transfers from Japan to countries other than the EEA/UK, we have put adequate measures in place to protect your Personal Information.</p>
<p>The transferees are obligated to comply with equivalent or comparable rules to those under the Act on the Protection of Personal Information of Japan (APPI) on a continuous basis, and we periodically confirm their compliance. We also periodically confirm any changes to the data privacy regulations of other countries that may affect the compliance measures taken by our overseas affiliates and third-party service providers and take measures such as requesting that they take corrective measures or suspending the provision of Personal Information if any issues arise in the implementation of such compliance measures. We will provide you with further information on the measures we take in this regard upon your request.</p>
<h2><strong>10. Retention </strong></h2>
<p>We retain Personal Information for as long as is necessary or as permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law, for example, for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. The criteria to determine our retention periods include:</p>
<ol><li>The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services);</li>
<li>Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or</li>
<li>Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).</li>
</ol><p>Where a legal obligation arises or retention is advisable in light of our legal position, in some circumstances, we will retain certain Personal Information, even after your account has been deleted and/or we no longer provide the Services to you; for example:</p>
<ul><li>To cooperate with law enforcement or public, regulatory&nbsp; and government authorities: If we receive a preservation order or search warrant, related to your Services account, we will preserve Personal Information subject to such order or warrant after you delete your Services account.</li>
<li>To comply with legal provisions on tax and accounting: We may retain your Personal Information after you delete your Personal Information, as required by tax law and to comply with bookkeeping requirements. Please note the length of time may vary by country.</li>
<li>For fraud and security purposes:&nbsp; We may retain your Personal Information for fraud/ security purposes such as IP address, User ID, Device ID, and unique app installation-specific ID, which can be used to investigate whether a specific device exhibits a pattern of abnormal app interaction behavior, which may indicate a malicious bot or fraudulent actor.</li>
<li>To pursue or defend a legal action: We may retain relevant Personal Information in the event of a legal claim or complaint, including regulatory investigations or legal proceedings about a claim related to your Personal Information, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation (whether in respect of our relationship with you or otherwise) after the dispute has been settled or decided by a court or tribunal from which there is no further right of appeal. The criteria for determining the length of time we will retain this information include:
<ul><li>Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, if the settlement or decision requires us to keep the records for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or</li>
<li>Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><h2><strong>11. Security</strong></h2>
<p>We employ a variety of measures to safeguard the collection, transmission, and storage of the information we collect. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process, and store, and the current state of technology. Please note that no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<p>If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the <a href="#_Contact_Us">“Contact Us”</a> section below</p>
<h2>12. Biometric Information&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Please note, Unity is a data controller for biometric information uploaded through SafeVoice. The following Section contains legal information which is only applicable under U.S. Law.</p>
<p>Your use of certain features may result in the collection of biometric information. Biometric information is any information based on an individual's biometric identifier used to identify an individual. Biometric information that may be collected depending on how you use Unity's products includes voice recordings. For example, if you are using Unity SafeVoice for in-app voice communication, that may be considered to be collecting biometric information under applicable laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use commercially reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative methods designed to protect biometric information within our organization.</p>
<p>We retain biometric information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purposes stated in this policy, unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by applicable law. For more information on the criteria used to determine our retention periods, please see the "Retention"&nbsp;section in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We will destroy or dispose of your biometric information as required by applicable law. For example, we may destroy electronic records of biometric information through such processes as overwriting magnetic media, degaussing, or physical destruction, and we may dispose of paper records by such processes as shredding or incineration.</p>
<p>Please note you may need to make your request for deletion through Unity’s customer as we may need our customer’s assistance to locate your account.</p>
